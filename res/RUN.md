# Running Simulation

Simulations using the OOTB platform are invoked though a user's web browser. The link is as follows.

```bash
http://192.168.1.5:8000
```

A few operations of OOTB and their screenshots are shows below.

To use OOTB, a user must login to the system. Every user must create and confirm the e-mail address before hand to get the logging credentials. The picture below shows the login screen.

The `Start new simulation` pull-down provides three options.

- Run a simulation by giving an `omnetpp.ini` file
- Run a simulation by creating a configuration using a wizard
- Run a benchmark simulation
